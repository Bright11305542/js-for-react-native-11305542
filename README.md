Array Manipulation and User Profiles
Student ID: 11305542
This project consists of three tasks:
1.	Task 1: Array Manipulation
•	In the arrayManipulation.js file, there is a processArray function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.
2.	Task 2: Formatting Array Strings
•	The arrayManipulation.js file also includes a formatArrayStrings function that takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the processArray function.
•	The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number: it capitalizes the entire string if the number is even, and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.
3.	Task 3: Creating User Profiles
•	The userInfo.js file contains a createUserProfiles function that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
•	The function returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and an auto-incremented id starting from 1.
These tasks demonstrate the use of JavaScript functions, array manipulation, and object creation to process and transform data. The code is organized into separate files to maintain modularity and readability.
